### Big O notation

```dart
Big O notation is used to represent the general form of time and space complexity.

Time and space complexity are high-level measures of scalability; they do not measure the actual speed of the algorithm itself.

For smal data sets, time complexity is usually irrelevant. A quasilinear algorithm can be slower than a quadratic algorithm.
